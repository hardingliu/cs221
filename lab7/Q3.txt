(i) Under 70%, over 70%
(ii) The larger the prime returns, the hash function perfroms better, so we 
use a for loop to find the largest prime that is smaller than the tablesize.
(iii) When the table size is a prime, with a hash2(k) not equal to 0 (as lar
ge as possible), double hasing will always find an empty slot without primar
y clustering nor secondary clustering.
(iv) I would choose double hashing, since it will not cause primary clusteri
ng nor secondary clustering. Also, with well chosen hash2(k) and tablesize, 
it will always find an empty slot. If the load factor is smaller than 1/2, w
e could choose linear probing or quadratic probing.

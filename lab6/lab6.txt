Q2: the average number of comparisons when NN=1000 is 11022
    the average number of comparisons when NN=100 is 647   
    the average number of comparisons when NN=10 is 24

Q4: C(n) = 0 if n <= 1;
    C(n) = (sigma(from i = 1 to n) of (n-1 + C(i-1) + C(n-i)))/n
Q5: (a):The running time for quicksort in the average case is: n*lg(n)
    (b):The running time for quicksort in the worst caseis: n^2
    (c):Since the worst case only arises when the input array is already sor
-ted 
    (d): Our implementation is not a stable sort. Since the relative positio
-n of two equal values will not be preserved.
    (e)Our implementation is an in-place sort. Since we do not need extra sp
-ace to copy the new array into.
